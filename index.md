# TechWorkshop L400: Copilot Studio and agents at work

## Customer scenario

Zava Retail Group is a global retail company operating in brick-and-mortar stores and a rapidly expanding e-commerce platform. To accelerate digital transformation, Zava established an AI Center of Excellence (COE) tasked with identifying high-impact, agentic AI opportunities that improve operational efficiency, employee productivity, and strategic decision-making. 

Zava operates in a hybrid cloud environment-Azure for productivity and analytics, AWS for certain legacy workloads, and SAP for supply chain and inventory. They rely on Microsoft 365, Teams, SharePoint, Azure DevOps (ADO), and a mix of third-party and custom systems. 

However, the COE faces pressure: 
Google and AWS teams are actively proposing AI solutions, and Zava's leadership wants to quickly identify a strategic partner with security, governance, extensibility, and enterprise-grade readiness.
