## Task 03: Connect the agent to the "Zava Retail Help Desk Bot" in Copilot Studio

### Introduction

Zava’s hybrid operating model requires specialized capabilities to plug into existing Copilot Studio experiences without breaking user workflows or governance controls. Connecting Foundry as an external agent demonstrates how Zava can extend Copilot Studio with deeper reasoning while keeping orchestration centralized.

### Description

In this task, you'll add the Foundry agent as a connected external agent to the Zava Retail Help Desk Bot. You'll configure the connection using the Azure AI Project Endpoint, provide the agent identity details, and ensure the integration is available for orchestration and testing.

### Success criteria

- The Foundry agent is successfully connected in Copilot Studio and is available as a callable external agent from the Zava Retail Help Desk Bot.
